# TextLogoMerger
this script can automatically apply text logo to any pic (you can define where you need it to be, custom text)

There are prebuild 2 fonts (not mine):
FrontPageNeue.otf
chant___.ttf

1. Create a folder called "Pictures" then put the images you want to want those logos
2. After that open main.py in any text editor and change the basic things you like to change like text
3. If you want to you can change advance in TextLogoMerger.py if you know what you do
4. Finally run the main.py
